Assist Doc is an advanced medical application developed to enhance communication between patients and
healthcare professionals, thereby improving health management and accessibility. The app provides patients
with features such as medication scheduling with reminders, symptom tracking for disease suggestions, browser
redirection for detailed health information, direct calls to healthcare providers, and locating nearby hospitals. For
healthcare professionals, the application offers tools to manage patient interactions through an integrated chat
system, organize and track appointments, and monitor patient medication adherence.
